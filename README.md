This is one of six homework assignments assigned by Professor Lowenthal in Brooklyn College's Data Structurs class during the Fall 2012 semester.  I can't vouch for the quality of the code, and I will note that it's heavily influenced by my experiences with Objective-C, but it's thoroughly commented and should be clean enough. 

The point of the assignment is to take data from File A (the transactions file), and merge it with data in File B (the accounts file). 

You can [see the full assignment in my iCloud Photo Stream, here](https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A1532ODWBszbz).

The idea is to read the data in from the transactions file and calculate the balance for each customer in the master file.

It's free for the taking, so use it, don't abuse it.
